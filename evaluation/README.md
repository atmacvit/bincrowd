## Evaluation (Stage-5) -- Sec 3.5
### How to evaluate your networks performance at a bin level 

This folder consists of a notebook that helps us evaluate the performance at a bin level. The jupyter notebook in this folder helps to generate plots that give performance strata-wise and pooled mean and std. The notebook requires 3 txt files for nobinning, Round Robin (rr) binning and Random Sampling (rs) binning. 

If you are interested in using the evaulation procedure for your network, you could make a copy of this colab notebook <Add colab notebook link>  and use the same.
