## Evaluation (Stage-5) -- Sec 3.5
### How to evaluate your networks performance at a bin level 

This folder consists of a [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LdNAc5hd0xwbqOZ2oHL007rr1Dw4TPRR?usp=sharing) that helps us evaluate the performance at a bin level. The txt files required for running the notebook are in this [drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c_6cyqN1g34tvS4uXEISsXkbcugFTBka?usp=sharing)

The Demo plot as in Default Approach , [SOTA](https://deepcount.iiit.ac.in/dashboard#sota) for NWPU Dataset can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LdNAc5hd0xwbqOZ2oHL007rr1Dw4TPRR#scrollTo=h2kMILSShVFc).

The Demo Plot as in Default Approach , [Overall](https://deepcount.iiit.ac.in/dashboard#all) performance of networks in terms of Pooled MAE +/- std can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LdNAc5hd0xwbqOZ2oHL007rr1Dw4TPRR#scrollTo=gdjk7W2rlLmm).
