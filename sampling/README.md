## Minibatch Sampling (Stage 3) -- Sec 3.3


The demo code for [DM Count](https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/DM-Count) is included in [```crowd.py```](crowd.py) , which is modified version of the original repo implementation. The procedure of normal data load has been replaced by loading from epoch wise json files as shown in [link](https://github.com/atmacvit/bincrowd/blob/a62276074b9f8bb25e6e1325f077f0320ca23ed6/sampling/crowd.py#L100)

The dataset-wise epoch json files can be found at :
