# Wisdom of (Binned) Crowds
<!-- Add the arvix and conference paper link here -->

### Official Implementation of ACMMM'21 paper "Wisdom of (Binned) Crowds: A Bayesian Stratification Paradigm for Crowd Counting"

## Overview Diagram

<!-- add the teaser  -->

## Data Preparation & Splits (Stages(1,2))
### How to find bins for new dataset

<!-- Refer it to the binning section of the repo -->

## Minibatch Sampling (Stage 3)
### How to sample the minibatch from bins

<!-- Refer it to a folder that shows a demo of the  sampling methods (in a colab notebook or a gf that shows demo of the sampling)
-->

## Optimization (Stage 4)
## How to include strata awware optimisation in your model
<!-- Add details of how to add the loss fucntion ( the loss function defined file should be placed in this folder) -->

## Evaluation (Stage-5)
## How to evaulate your networks performance at a bin level 

<!-- Add a notebook that akes the model and architecture loads it return the mean and std and if a dataset name and its bins are provided generates the bin level plots (like our website) -->
